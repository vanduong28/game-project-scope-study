-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

  - [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ua2GYJC.jpg)(includes mobile view as well)
-   The data structure you plan to use.
  - I will have a game object but unsure if the player actions will be part of
    that object or separate. Need more work on developing this structure.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  - I will make 9 divs to represent each square in the game board. In JS I
    will represent them as arrays and identify the 8 winning patterns as arrays
-   How you plan to approach this project.
  - I will begin with a creating creating the board using HTML/CSS. Next I will
    break down the JS pieces into manageable components so I can focus on one
    piece at a time.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    - As a player I want to be able to create an account so I can track my games
    - As a player I want to be able to login to my account so I can see my
      account info
    - As a player I want to be able to logout of my account
    - As a player I want to be able to change my account password
    - As a player I want to be able to start a new game
    - As a player I want to be able to quit a game at anytime
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
  - I will separate my code into many small files for 'peace of mind' rather than
    creating all code in one large file.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  - If I have time for the bonus work I would like to add styling features such
    as the cursor appearing an 'X' or 'O' to indicate who's turn it is.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  - I will make commits often and early and ensure I make commits based on the
    feature I am working on.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  - I would like to apply styling (hover effects or animation) if I have time

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
